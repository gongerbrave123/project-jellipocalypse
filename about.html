<h1>What's Project Jellipocalypse?</h1>

<h1>First...</h1>

<p>Cookie Wars was a real-time strategy spin-off of the Cookie Run series, developed by Devsisters and OrumLabs. Unlike the franchise’s iconic endless runners, Cookie Wars threw cookies into battle against corrupted "Jelly Walkers" in a chaotic, colorful tower-defense-style war. The game launched in 2018 but was sadly discontinued in May 2020 due to low retention and halted development. Despite its short lifespan, it gained a cult following thanks to its charming art style, deep strategy mechanics, and animated storytelling.

<h1>Now...</h1>

after years of silence, the world of Cookie Wars is rising again—this time under a new name: Project Jellipocalypse.
While not a direct sequel, Project Jellipocalypse is a spiritual remake and reimagining of the original Cookie Wars. It retains the fan-favorite concept of cookies battling jelly-mutated monstrosities in real-time strategy battles—but with revamped mechanics, darker lore, and modern visuals.
